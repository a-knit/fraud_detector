# Fraud Detector

This was a case study project in fraud detection.

Using a Logistic Regression with Powell's method, we were able to detect fraud with 98.8% recall while maintaining 76.4% accuracy (off of a 50% threshold). The webapp takes in new observations from a live webstream and determines whether there is a high, medium, or low chance of fraud based on the predicted probability.
